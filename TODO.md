# TODO - RogueLiteUO Development

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS - Ready for Manual Setup!

**Code Implementation:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Manual Setup in Godot:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED (see below)
**Friend Playtest:** Ready after setup (15-20 min)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MANUAL SETUP REQUIRED (Do These in Godot)

### Critical (Game Won't Work Without):
1. **Create projectile.tscn** (5 min) ‚Üí See `PROJECTILE_SETUP.md`
   - Needed for Mage ranged attacks and Ranger enemies
   - Without this: Mage/Ranger won't attack but won't crash

2. **Add Archetype Selectors to hub.tscn** (5 min) ‚Üí See `ARCHETYPE_SETUP.md`
   - 3 Area2D zones (Warrior/Mage/Support)
   - Without this: Stuck as warrior only

### Important (Game Works, But Missing Features):
3. **Add SkillDisplayUI to test_dungeon.tscn** (1 min) ‚Üí See `SKILL_UI_SETUP.md`
   - Shows "MELEE/RANGED/SUPPORT" and HP in-game

4. **Create Enemy Variants** (10 min) ‚Üí See `ENEMY_VARIETY_SETUP.md`
   - enemy_tank.tscn (slow, 100HP, red)
   - enemy_ranger.tscn (fast, 30HP, shoots, blue)
   - Update dungeon to 5 mixed enemies

### Optional (Polish):
5. **Camera Shake + Audio** ‚Üí See `AUDIO_SETUP.md`
   - CameraShake node for screen shake
   - AudioStreamPlayer nodes for sound effects
